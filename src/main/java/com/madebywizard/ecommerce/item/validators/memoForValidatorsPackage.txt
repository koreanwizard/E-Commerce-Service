ItemValidator:
- This object includes an 'execute' method with 'Item' parameter.
- It checks every specific attribute from a new 'Item' object.
- It will be executed when we send 'POST' or 'PUT' requests.
- Because we are creating (or updating) a data so we need to check if those new aspects are valid.
- If one of the condition is true from the 'execute' method, it will throw an ItemNotValidException with a specific 'ErrorMessages' enum.

* isValidNum: if category == "type" -> check the element is part of 'ItemType' enum.
              else -> check the element is part of 'ItemSize' enum.

* isAlphabetic: checks if our current string is alphabetical.

CAN BE USED IN THE FUTURE:
- isAlphanumeric: checks if our current string is alphanumerical.
- isValidDate: checks if our current 'LocalDate' object contains a proper format
             it requires a "yyyy-MM-dd" format
