User:
A 'User' is a class that will be linked to the database: this is an Entity (jpa).
The user contains:
- Id (generated automatically and will be used from the database)
- name (a full name)
- sex (user's sex -> 'M' or 'F')
- birth date (user's birth date -> data type is java.sql.Date because this will be used in mysql)
- user id (user's id that will be used in the service -> an alphanumerical string (should have a length limit)
- user password (this should not be stored directly into our database -> should be ENCRYPTED)

* @JsonFormat
- By using  annotation, the date attribute from JSON input (from podman) converts to java.sql.Date type
and added into the database.

* nullable = false
- This make Spring Boot and Hibernate will enforce 'birthDate' cannot be null from the database.

* The @Column name and the local variable should be same (이것때문에 podman 에서 json 파일 형식으로 create request
실험해볼때 계속 에러 났었음 ('birthDate' is null)


* DateTimeFormatter
- The 'DateTimeFormatter' formats the LocalDateTime to a specific pattern -> in our case, we should use the
pattern "yyyy-MM-dd" because we should store the LocalDateTime into our database (the database includes a birth
