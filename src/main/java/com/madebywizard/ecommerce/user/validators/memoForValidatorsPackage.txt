UserValidator:
This object includes an 'execute' method with 'User' parameter.
It checks every specific attribute from a new 'User' object.
It will be executed when we send 'POST' or 'PUT' request.
Because we are creating (or updating) a data so we need to check if those new aspects are valid.
If one of the condition is true from the 'execute' method, it will throw an UserNotValidException
with a specific 'ErrorMessages' enum.

isAlphabetic: checks if our current string is alphabetical.
isAlphanumeric: checks if our current string is alphanumerical.
isValidDate: checks if our current 'LocalDate' object contains a proper format
             it requires a "yyyy-MM-dd" format
