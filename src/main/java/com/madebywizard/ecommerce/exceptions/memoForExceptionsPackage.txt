UserNotFoundException:
This exception occurs when user is not found. The error message is an 'ErrorMessages' enum object.
It uses a 'getMessage' method to get the message (String).



GlobalExceptionHandler:
This exists to manage various exception handlers in one global location.
It includes a @ControllerAdvice to easily handle exceptions.
The @ControllerAdvice will handle exceptions that are located in 'GlobalExceptionHandler' with
@ExceptionHandler annotation.

  - handleUserNotFoundException: An exception that will occur when user is not found. It takes an 'UserNotFoundException'
  as a parameter and it will return a ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> with HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND (404) and passing a 'ErrorResponse'
  as a body of the response.

  - handleUserNotValidException: An exception that will occur when user information is not valid. The rest of logic is
  same as 'handleUserNotFoundException' method but it includes the HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST (400).
