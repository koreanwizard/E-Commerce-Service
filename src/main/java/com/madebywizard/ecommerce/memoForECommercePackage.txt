CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
A design pattern that categorizes operations into two categories
-> queries (read data)
-> commands (update or modify data)

We use two different interfaces (Query and Command) about user services.

The 'create', 'delete', and 'update' user services can possibly modify data so
it can be defined as 'command' type operation.

However, the 'get' user service only read data without changing it so it can be
defined as a 'query' type operation.
